Find the proportion of employees in each department who are grade 1.
	Hints
	Think of the desired proportion for a given department as the number of 
	employees in that department who are grade 1, divided by the total number 
	of employees in that department.

	You can write an expression in a SELECT statement, e.g. grade = 1. 
	This would result in BOOLEAN values.

	If you could convert BOOLEAN to INTEGER 1 and 0, you could sum them. 
	The CAST() function lets you convert data types.

	In SQL, an INTEGER divided by an INTEGER yields an INTEGER. To get a REAL 
	value, you need to convert the top, bottom or both sides of the division 
	to REAL. */

Get a list of the id, first_name, last_name, department, salary and fte_hours

employee’s fte_hours to that department’s average fte_hours.

[Extension - really tough! - how could you generalise your query to be able to
 handle the fact that two or more departments may be tied in their counts of 
 employees. In that case, we probably don’t want to arbitrarily return details 
 for employees in just one of these departments].
	Hints
	Writing a CTE to calculate the name, average salary and average fte_hours 
	of the largest department is an efficient way to do this.
	Another solution might involve combining a subquery with window functions.*/

/*Question 2.
Have a look again at your table for MVP question 6. It will likely contain a 
blank cell for the row relating to employees with ‘unknown’ pension enrollment 
status. This is ambiguous: it would be better if this cell contained ‘unknown’ 
or something similar. Can you find a way to do this, perhaps using a 
combination of COALESCE() and CAST(), or a CASE statement?
	Hints
	*COALESCE() lets you substitute a chosen value for NULLs in a column, e.g. 
	*COALESCE(text_column, 'unknown') would substitute 'unknown' for every NULL 
	*in text_column. The substituted value has to match the data type of the 
	*column otherwise PostgreSQL will return an error.
	CAST() let’s you change the data type of a column, e.g. CAST(boolean_column 
	AS VARCHAR) will turn TRUE values in boolean_column into text 'true', 
	FALSE to text 'false', and will leave NULLs as NULL/ */

Use a CASE() operator to group employees who are members of committees into

A NULL salary should lead to 'none' in salary_class. Count the number of
